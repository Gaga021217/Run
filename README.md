# Run!
Run! is a game where the player is trying to get away from its chasers, while luring them into traps. The player also has to avoid the traps, but unlike the chasers, they can see where they are. 

The player moves with W, A, S and D keys. They are the green square on the playing field. The red squares are traps and the yellow ones are the chasers. The chasers move at different speeds based on the difficulty. The difficulty also changes the amount of traps laid out. You can also change the size of the playng field.

The WinForms and WPF versions work fine, but the MAUI version is not finished. This version is not intended for just the downloading of the game, but for the inspection of the code. You can, of course, try the game by running it in Visual Studio.
