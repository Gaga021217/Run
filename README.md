# Run!
Run! is a game where the player is trying to get away from its chasers, while luring them into traps. The player also has to avoid the traps, but unlike the chasers, the player can see where the traps are. 

The player moves with W, A, S and D keys. They are the green square on the playing field. The red squares are traps and the yellow ones are the chasers. The chasers move at different speeds based on the difficulty. The difficulty also changes the amount of traps laid out. You can also change the size of the playng field.

This version is not intended for playing, just code inspection. It can, however, be run, after cloning the project and running it in Visual Studio.
